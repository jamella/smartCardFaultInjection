smartCardFaultInjection
=======================

contains files for testing fault injection attacks on smart cards signing with RSA
OutputPriKey.java is an applet that will sign with RSA or output public/private key information.
checkOutput.py will look through the results of automatic fault injection testing.
ChavisSummerReportWithLinks.docx is the report I wrote about what has been done in this project.
automaticFaultInjection.v is the verilog code that used for programming a FPGA board to do automatic fault injections
verify.py verifies an RSA signature.
